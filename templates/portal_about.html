        <p>
            {{ config['APP_NAME'] }} attempts to capture the current body of knowledge on how genetic alterations affect clinical
            actionability. As the field of precision medicine grows, the quantity of research on how specific alterations
            affect therapeutic response and patient prognosis expands at an increasing rate. {{ config['APP_NAME'] }} seeks to curate this
            information from the literature, increasing the abilities of clinicians and researchers alike to rapidly
            assess the importance of an alteration.

            Each feature represented in the almanac (e.g., "somatic variant," "knockdown," etc.) is represented in a separate tab-separated value (TSV) file.
            The collection of TSV files representing the entire Almanac database is provided in a single ZIP file.
